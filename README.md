# UART Sniffer
Debug 2 UART/Serial/COM Devices at once



    ("UART-Sniffer") Is an C# WinForm Application for Q2D Solutions & SICS,
    while working with CC2538 ARM Development Kit & TI SmartEB06 Boards
    
    // Build by me to provide an easy way to Debug 2 UART Devices at once
    
    

 
* Default Baudrate in this project is 115200 - enable the others in the code

* Handshake, Stopbits &  Parity are disabled by default.... enable them in the code if you need them


# How-To-Use
- Start UART Sniffer
- Connect the device/devices you want to debug
- Click on "Hämta Port Settings" to fetch COM input from UART device
- Then click "Feed Stängd" to open ang get live data feed
